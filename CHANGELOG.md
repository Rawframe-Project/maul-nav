1.0.0, any minor release may change the API, the ABI and every data
format.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- The library skeleton: the build, the family rules and tools, the
  version and result API (`mnavGetVersion`, `mnavResultName`) and the
  library profile.
- The bake's settings and input surface (`maul-nav/bake.h`): the bake
  def with its agent profile and named limits, checked and converted
  from meters to cells by `mnavValidateBakeDef`, and triangle meshes
  checked as hostile input by `mnavValidateTriangleMesh`.
- Results `mnav_errorLimit` and `mnav_errorRange`, the allocator, and
  the `mnavVec3` and `mnavPos3` types.
- Tile rasterization (internal): triangles clip into per-cell fragments,
  which sort and merge into each column's solid spans, so a tile's
  heightfield depends only on the set of input triangles, not their
  order (N12). Its hash is pinned across platforms.
- The walkable filters (internal): spans within a step above walkable
  ground become walkable, ledges and steep neighbors are removed, and
  so is ground without the agent's height of free space (N13).
